PROJECT NAME: Automated Parking Garage

DESCRIPTION: A website which replaces the need for human parking garage employees. The interface reserves spots, takes payments, facilitates entry, and marks exits.

INSTALLATION: Simply download the repository. 

USAGE: 
Simply click on "index.html" in the main folder.
If you are a registered user, click on sign-in or if you want to reserve, click on reserve (for a speedy reservation).
If you aren't a registered user, you can still press reserve, you will be automatically signed-up, or alternatively, you can sign-up using the sign-in button.
You can also contact us, read the about page or continue towards viewing your account.
Many parts of the project do not work as a whole right now because none of our group members are maintaining anything anymore. An experienced programmer, however, can play around with the files in the folder to see how the blockchain works or see different subpages look like.
